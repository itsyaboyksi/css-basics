                    The language processor that reads the complete source program written in high level language as a whole in one go and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language is called as a Compiler.
					In a compiler, the source code is translated to object code successfully if it is free of errors. The compiler specifies the errors at the end of compilation with line numbers when there are any errors in the source code.
					The errors must be removed before the compiler can successfully recompile the source code again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In computer science an assembler is a program that turns assembly language into machine code. An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's 
					processor can use to perform its basic operations. The Assembler is used to translate the program written in Assembly language into machine code. The source program is a input of assembler that contains assembly language instructions. The output generated by 
					assembler is the object code or machine code understandable by the computer.

                <p>
                    The translation of single statement of source program into machine code is done by language processor and executes it immediately before moving on to the next line is called an interpreter. If there is an error in the statement, the interpreter terminates its 
					translating process at that statement and displays an error message. The interpreter moves on to the next line for execution only after removal of the error. An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without 
					previously converting them to an object code or machine code.
